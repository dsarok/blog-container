1,Homelander, The Homelander (John Gillman)[1][2] is a supervillain and the main antagonist of the comic book series The Boys and the media franchise of the same name, created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. The character is depicted as an egotistical and sadistic narcissist who serves as the extremely powerful leader of The Seven—a group of corrupt and hedonistic superheroes funded by Vought-American—and the archenemy of Billy Butcher. Beneath his public image as a noble and altruistic hero, the Homelander cares little about the well-being of those he professes to protect.

In the Amazon Prime Video television adaptation developed by Eric Kripke, Homelander is portrayed by Antony Starr. This version is the megalomaniacal son of Soldier Boy and the father of Ryan Butcher, who was born as a result of Homelander raping Billy Butcher's wife, Becca (a crime that was originally commited by Black Noir in the comic book series). Homelander has also appeared in the spin-off and promotional web series The Boys Presents: Diabolical and Death Battle!, respectively. Described as the living personification of how the world sees America,[3][4] the character has received critical acclaim along with Starr's portrayal in the series.[5][6] Homelander has been compared to Superman and Captain America.[7][8][9][10]
